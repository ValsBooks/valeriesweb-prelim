                        <p class="about-p"> My current home base is in Illinois, outside of Chicago. I have been an accountant for many years. Through this I have acquired skills in several detail-oriented areas, including but not limited to: Excel, Data Modeling, Forecasting, and generally just making sure the business world is in perfect balance and fully reconciled.</p>
                        <p class="about-p"> Having started several websites of my own for side-businesses using templates offered by a webhost, the lack of options for design editing quickly became frustrating. I then did some research into web development and liked what I saw. The journey into tech started when I realized this vocation allowed me be to both creative and structured at the same time. For an accountant ~ adding a creative side to my natural inclination for precision and perfection ~ this was GOLD! </p>
                        <p class="about-p"> While learning how to build this first website, I realized I have found something that gives me the freedom and versatility I have been looking for. I am still happily in the learning process, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegent code and I'm having a great time along the way! I look forward to helping others with their web development goals. Current area of study: Front-end development. What am I totally psyched about these days? Learning back-end development and programming, of course. </p>
                        <p class="about-p">Let the fun begin!</p>
